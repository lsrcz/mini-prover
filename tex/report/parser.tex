\section{Lexer and Parser}
The parser is implemented as a simple $LL(\infty)$ parser using parser combinators so it may be quite slow on large inputs, but it's sufficient
for our purpose.

Our AST for terms is defined as follows, for brevity, AST for other objects are not described here.

\begin{center}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
type Name = String
type Index = Int

data Term =
    TmRel
      Name       -- name of the variable, used for pretty printing
      Index      -- 0 based DeBruijn index
  | TmVar
      Name       -- name of the variable
  | TmAppl
      [Term]     -- the first is the abstraction and the rest are the arguments
  | TmProd
      Name       -- name of the abstracted variable, used for pretty printing
      Term       -- type of the abstracted variable
      Term       -- body of the abstraction
  | TmLambda
      Name       -- name of the abstracted variable, used for pretty printing
      Term       -- type of the abstracted variable
      Term       -- body of the abstraction
  | TmFix
      Int        -- the index of the decreasing variable
      Term       -- body of the fix definition
  | TmLetIn
      Name       -- name of the local binding variable
      Term       -- type of the local binding
      Term       -- body of the local binding
      Term       -- let body, the binding will be added here
  | TmIndType
      Name       -- name of the inductive type constructor
      [Term]     -- argument list
  | TmConstr
      Name       -- name of the term constructor
      [Term]     -- argument list
  | TmType
  | TmTypeHigher
  | TmMatch
      Int        -- how many parameters does the inductive type need
      Term       -- the term pattern matching on
      Name       -- the name of the local binding of the term in the return type
      [Name]     -- the matching name list for the return type
      Term       -- return type
      [Equation] -- equations, described below
  deriving (Eq, Show)

data Equation =
    Equation
      [Name]     -- matching name list for the term constructor
      Term       -- body of the equation
    deriving (Eq, Show)
\end{minted}
