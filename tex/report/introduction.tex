\section{Introduction}

In modern mathematical and computer science world, providing a proof is hard, but confirming its correctness
is sometimes not a easy work as well. In November 2015, Babai announced a quasipolynomial 
time algorithm for graph isomorphism problem, where Harald Helfgott discovered a flaw. 
Though Babai re-announced a correction in 2017, the new proof has not been fully peer-reviewed yet.\par
On the other hand, some famous problems have been solved with the help of computer programs,
for example \href{http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/200811/tx081101382p.pdf}{proving {\it Four Color Theorem} using Coq}.\par
The key idea is that although searching for proofs is an undeciable and unpractical task with respect to the 
limited computation power and ability of computer, 
checking the validity of a certain proof can be done in computer with the help of type system.\par
In our implementation, using {\it Curry-Howard isomorphism}, programs, properties, and proofs are formalized in the same 
language -- {\it Calculus of Inductive Constructions}, which is a $\lambda$-calculus with an enriched type system.
