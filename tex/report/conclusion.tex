\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we have built a proof assistant, that can automatically check the validity
of the user-inputted proof. This project demonstrates the power of type system and type theory,
which is indeed fascinating.\par
Despite of these, we have to admit that due to the limited time and energy, 
this is the best we can offer. It is likely that some bug remains unspotted in the code.

\section{Division of Labour}

This table roughly summarizes everyone's part in this project. 
But the division is not that restrict.
